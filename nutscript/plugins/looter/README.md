## loot
randomly spawning loot based on loot tables

tables can have invidual item chances, or table chances (which then have item chances), but CANNOT be mixed, tables with table chances are defined by `istableloot = true,` in that table

loot tables and other config stuff are changed in the plugin, however actual spawns are done via commands

suits from shoottorp has custom stuff to allow random durability, and junk items from crafting will only drop with a single quantity, theres also implemenation for custom things i wont release due to the extensive setup that is required for it
